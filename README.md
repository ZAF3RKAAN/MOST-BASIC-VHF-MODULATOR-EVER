# MOST-BASIC-VHF-MODULATOR-EVER
 An extremely primitive video modulator based on the Colpitts Oscillator, created with a single transistor and an LC tank.

Use a BF199 or BF494, or as a last resort, a 2N2222. This corresponds to approximately 104MHz, but as the transistor heats up, its gain ratio and internal capacitance will change, likely causing the frequency to drift very quickly.

Once you've assembled the circuit, wait for the transistor to reach its operating temperature (approximately 1-2 minutes) to allow the frequency to stabilize, and then adjust your TV tuner settings accordingly.
